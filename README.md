  Start cloning akuse:

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/akuse-app/akuse.git
  ```
  
  Next, go to [this link](https://anilist.co/settings/developer) and create a new AniList API Client.
  As Redirect Uri, you can insert `akuse://index,https://anilist.co/api/v2/oauth/pin` (these are two space seprated uri) and it should work.
  Now go inside the src/modules folder and create a clientData.ts file with a structure like this:
  
  ```bash
  import { ClientData } from "../types/types";
  
  export const clientData: ClientData = {
    clientId: ,
    redirectUri: "",
    clientSecret: "",
  };
  ```
  
  Fill it with the data retrieved from the creation of your AniList API Client.
  
  ```bash
  # Example:
  import { ClientData } from "../types/types";
  
  export const clientData: ClientData = {
    clientId: 12345,
    redirectUri: 'akuse://index',
    clientSecret: 'iA04TKLO3k3LaVWhxucJwck0glR6uhiv',
  };
  ```
  
  Next, install its dependencies (make sure npm is installed on your machine):
  
  ```
  npm install
  ```
  
  To start, run:
  
  ```
  npm start
  ```

      ```
      npm start
      ```
        or

      ./path/to/app.AppImage
      ```

  3. Finally, paste your code and push the button. If the code you entered is correct, you are now Logged-in, othwerise repeat these steps and see what has gone wrong.
